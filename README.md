# Elongation Rate

Codes used in the paper "Aging-associated changes in transcriptional elongation influence metazoan longevity" (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05922-y).

Analysis of genome-wide, aging-related changes in transcriptional processes across different organisms: nematode worms, fruit flies, mice, rats and humans. The average transcriptional elongation speed (Pol-II speed) increased with age in all five species. Along with these changes in elongation speed we observed changes in splicing, including a reduction of unspliced transcripts and the formation of more circular RNAs. Genetic variants in Pol-II that reduced its speed in worms and flies increased their lifespan. Similarly, reducing Pol-II speed by overexpressing histone components, to counter age-associated changes in nucleosome positioning, also extended lifespan in flies and the division potential of human cells.

The R code that is contained in the scripts was developed in R 4.2.1, under Linux Ubuntu 22. For further questions, please contact: apapada1@uni-koeln.de.
