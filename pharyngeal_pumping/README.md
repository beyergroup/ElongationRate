# Measurements of pharyngeal pumping rates in worms

Synchronized wild-type and ama-1(m322) animals were placed on regular NGM plates seeded with OP50 bacteria on day 1 and day 8 of adulthood, and the pharyngeal pumping rate was assessed by observing the number of pharyngeal contractions during a 10 second interval using a dissecting microscope and Leica Application Suite X imaging software. The pharyngeal pumping rate was then adjusted for the number of pharyngeal pumping per minute. 

Animals that displayed bursting, internal hatching and death were excluded from the experiments. Experiments were repeated three independent times in a blinded manner, scoring a minimum of 15 randomly selected animals per genotype and time point for each experiment. One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test was used for statistical significance testing, with ****P < 0.0001, and error bars representing standard deviation.
