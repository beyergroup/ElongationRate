# Histone overexpression

IMR90 cell populations were generated homogeneously overexpressing GFP-tagged H3 or H4 in an inducible manner. Reduction of Pol II speed was accompanied by markedly reduced senescence-associated Î²-galactosidase staining in H3-overexpressing or H4-overexpressing cells compared with both control (GFP only) and uninduced cells. Additionally,overexpression of either histone resulted in significant reduction of Pol II speed.
