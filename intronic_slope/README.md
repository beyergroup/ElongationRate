# Slope based on intronic read distribution

To calculate Pol II speeds, we used RNA-seq data obtained from total RNA and nascent RNA enrichment. In contrast to the widely used polyA enrichment method, which primarily captures mature, spliced mRNAs and is therefore not suitable to estimate Pol II speeds based on intronic reads, these methods yield sufficient intronic coverage to quantify elongation rates. To analyse the distribution of intronic reads between conditions, we devised a score for each intron. We fitted the read gradient (slope) along each of the selected introns (5′→3′).
