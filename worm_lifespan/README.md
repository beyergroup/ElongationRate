# Worm demography assays

Nematodes were cultured using standard techniques at 20 °C on NGM agar plates and were fed with Escherichia coli strain OP50. The DR786 strain carrying the ama-1(m322) IV mutation in the large subunit of Pol II (RBP1), which confers α-amanitin resistance, was obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center. The DR786 strain was then outcrossed into wild-type N2 strain four times and the mutation was confirmed by sequencing. The 5′–3′ AGAAGGTCACACAATCGGAATC primer was used for sequencing. For each genotype, a minimum of 120 age-matched day 1 young adults were scored every other day for survival and transferred to new plates to avoid starvation and carry-over progeny.

Lifespan analyses using the C. elegans Lifespan Machine were then conducted. In brief, wild-type N2 and mutant worms were synchronized by egg-prep (hypochlorite treatment) and grown on NGM agar plates seeded with OP50 at 20 °C. Upon reaching L4 stage, these worms were transferred onto plates containing 0.1 g ml−1 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (FUDR) and placed into the modified flatbed scanners (35 worms per plate). The scan interval was 30 min. Objects falsely identified as worms were censored. Time of death was automatically determined by the C. elegans Lifespan Machine. Demography experiments were repeated multiple times. For all experiments, genotypes were blinded. Statistical analyses were performed using the Mantel–Cox log-rank method.

This folder contains the original lifespan data used for **Figure 2b** and **Extended Data Figure 8a**. More precisely, the files contain information about:

a)the survival of wild-type and ama-1(m322) mutant worms conferring a slow Pol-II elongation rate.
b)the number of censored worms for each genotype
